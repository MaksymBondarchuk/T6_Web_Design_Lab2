        <img src="files/Tuco1.jpg"  alt="Tuco1">
        <p>Tuco is known for his erratic personality and propensity for extreme violence. Tuco's personality makes him one of the most dangerous drug dealers of New Mexico, since he is able to kill even people close to him without showing remorse if they ever do something disrespectful on his point of view. Even though, Tuco shows signs of being extremely loyal to the people he truly trusts. His family is tied to the Ju√°rez Cartel, as his uncle Tio Salamanca was one of the highest ranking members of the cartel. Tuco's cousins were hit-men for the cartel also. Tuco was trained by Tio in the art of selling and distributing meth. He groomed Tuco to eventually take his place in the organization when Tio was unable to. It is revealed that Tio treated Tuco as a son, showing how strong the bond between uncle and nephew was.</p>
